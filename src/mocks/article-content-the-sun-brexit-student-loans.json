Their default rate was roughly the same as that of Brits.\n\nA study by the Higher Education Policy Institute found EU students generate an average net economic gain for the UK of \u00a371,000 each.\n\nThat compares with \u00a3102,000 for those who come here to study from countries outside the bloc.\n\nResearchers estimated all international students are worth roughly \u00a328.8bn a year to the British economy.\n",
